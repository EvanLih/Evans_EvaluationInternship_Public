# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
## Program Overview

Student internships play a critical role in the curriculum of the Evans School. However, many of the internships
that Evans students accept are unpaid or appreciably underpaid. Although there is significant progress from the
AB Committee and the Career Development (CD) Team in increasing paid internship connections, the target goal
of 80% paid internships has not been reached yet. This summer’s evaluation of the Internship Program marks the
first formal evaluation of the Evans School Internship Program. This evaluation seeks to assess existing trends
around historic internship information to identify gaps and opportunities for better reporting and data collection,
with the end-goal of creating data-driven strategic recommendations that best highlights what the CD Team & AB
Committee can do to most efficiently & effectively to improve the internship program.

## Evaluation Questions and Design

Given this background, the CD Team decided to conduct a process-impact evaluation. The process evaluation
determines if processes/resources the CD Team are working as intended, while the impact portion seeks to
quantify the effectiveness of the internship program in achieving its overall goal – providing a valuable and
impactful experience to Evans students.

To this purpose, the CD team created tailored surveys towards three target groups: current Evans students,
employers who had previously supervised Evans interns, and Evans alumni. Evans students participating in the
survey are rising second years (transitioning from their first to second academic year). Employer data was
gathered based on student-provided information in their internship graduation forms^1. Lastly, we selected alumni
who graduated from the Evans School between 2013 - 2017 —these years were chosen so that internships
completed were still recent enough for alumni to reflect, but far enough out that alumni were able to critically
assess the impact on their career experience. Alumni who expressed interest were also interviewed in individual
follow-up phone interviews.

## This program evaluation sought to address three key primary questions:

```
(1) What are expectations and preferences around internships? How do these vary for Evans alumni, current
Evans students, and employers/supervisors of Evans interns?
(2) Taking into consideration these expectations and preferences, how can the CD Team and AB Committee
create alignment between these three stakeholder groups in order to reduce the number of unpaid
internships Evans students accept?
(3) How can the CD Team change internally to better support Evans students and employers through the
internship program?
```
(^1) All Evans Students who pursue an internship are required to fill out an internship evaluation form. This form, among other
things, asks for their supervisor’s contact information.
